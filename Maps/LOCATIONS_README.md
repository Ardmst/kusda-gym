Preview the static Kusda Gym location page

- Open `locations.preview.html` in a browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).
- The page uses Leaflet and MarkerCluster via CDN and requires internet access.

Quick edits:
- To update branch data edit the `gyms` array inside `locations.preview.html`.
- To remove marker cluster replace the MarkerCluster CDN lines and remove related code.

If you want a Blade/laravel-integrated version later, tell me and I'll convert it to `resources/views/locations.blade.php` using your site's layout.
